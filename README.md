# iOS_Test-Device_Photos.sqlite_Examples
This repo will contain several iOS Photos.sqlite databases, both Local Photo Library (LPL) db’s and Shared with You Syndication Photo Library (SWY) db’s that can be used to test Photos.sqlite queries. This repo will not contain every database that has been used during my testing and documentation, but it will contain a lot of them. These test device db’s might contain examples of the following:
Hidden assets
Recently Deleted assets
Albums 
Shared Albums 
Cloud Photo Library Assets (CPLAssets)
Optimize iPhone Storage assets and thumbnail data
Imported assets from Snapchat, WhatsApp, AirDrop, Messages, 3rd Party editing apps, and others
